# Pandas Challenge

This repository contains the work for the Pandas Challenge, which involves performing data analysis using the Pandas library in Python. The goal is to work with a dataset of school-related information and generate meaningful insights by cleaning, transforming, and analyzing the data.

## Project Overview

The project includes the following key tasks:

1. **Data Cleaning**: Preprocessing the data to handle missing values, incorrect data types, and irrelevant columns.
2. **Data Transformation**: Aggregating, merging, and categorizing data based on various attributes such as school size, school type, and spending.
3. **Data Analysis**: Generating summary statistics and visualizations for insights related to school performance, budget, and spending.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of information about different schools, including the following columns:

- **School Type**: The type of the school (e.g., charter, district).
- **Total Students**: The total number of students enrolled in the school.
- **Total School Budget**: The total budget allocated to the school.
- **Per Student Budget**: The budget allocated per student.
- **Average Maths Score**: The average maths score for students at the school.
- **Average Reading Score**: The average reading score for students at the school.
- **Passing Maths Percentage**: The percentage of students passing maths.
- **Passing Reading Percentage**: The percentage of students passing reading.
- **Overall Passing Rate**: The overall passing rate of students across subjects.
- **School Size**: Categorization of schools based on the number of students (e.g., small, medium, large).

## Files in the Repository

- **PyCitySchools.ipynb**: The Jupyter notebook containing the analysis and insights.
- **Resources**: Directory containing the raw CSV data files (e.g., `students_complete.csv`, `schools_complete.csv`).
- **.gitignore**: A file to specify which files and directories should be ignored by Git.
- **.ipynb_checkpoints**: Checkpoint files generated by Jupyter during the analysis.
